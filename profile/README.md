# About Code.AI
Code.AI is a community dedicated for all things related to AI for code. In this community we not only discuss deep learning or code generation, we also discuss things like evolutionary computation and code documentation! It is a great place to find fellow like-minded researchers and developers, build a team of collaborators, find a project to work on, or brainstorm project and research ideas! If you are interested in AI on code please join us using our [Discord community link](https://discord.gg/68NZFfxHxD)!
